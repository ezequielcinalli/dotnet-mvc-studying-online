![screenshot](StudyingOnline/wwwroot/images/screenshot.png)

The project is a recreation of [TPE-WEB2 (php)](https://github.com/gabrielballone/TPE-WEB2) using the ASP.NET core.

The following technologies are used:
- [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio) as web user interface

- [Entity framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) for data layer management

- [Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio) for user management


## User accounts

For development purposes 2 user accounts are provided with the seed data:

- Email = "admin@admin.com", Password = "123",
- Email = "no-admin@admin.com", Password = "123",

In case of deleting all accounts, the first account to be created will automatically be admin
